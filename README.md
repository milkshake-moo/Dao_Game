Make a Dao game!


## Welcome to the Dao Game Repository!

We had an idea to try a fun collaborative project to code a game of Dao to be playable over the web. This is our first attempt at developing something like this and we are motivated to learn along the way!

Dao is a simple strategy board game and has developed a cult following among the friend group. It is played on a 16-space board with 4 stones per player. The players take turns moving one stone at a time in aggressive and defensive strategies towards various "win conditions", or certain permutations on the board.

### Our idea
We had an idea to create a LAN-connected or web-hosted server to run a Dao game interface between two players. The gameplay could be coded in JavaScript or Python.
We want to have the gameplay be easy and user-friendly, while also providing features such as player names, game statistics, play history, and fun easter eggs with the game board.
Drawing on some of our previous experience coding simple Python GUI object-oriented games in school projects, we thought we could create something more advanced and robust while following the basic principles and backbone of our previous work.
